# 
#     Set the state for each Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rule.
# 
#     After enabling this setting, you can set each rule to the following in the Options section:
#     - Block: the rule will be applied
#     - Audit Mode: if the rule would normally cause an event, then it will be recorded (although the rule will not actually be applied)
#     - Off: the rule will not be applied
# 
#     Enabled:
#     Specify the state for each ASR rule under the Options section for this setting.
#     Enter each rule on a new line as a name-value pair:
#     - Name column: Enter a valid ASR rule ID
#     - Value column: Enter the status ID that relates to state you want to specify for the associated rule
# 
#     The following status IDs are permitted under the value column:
#     - 1 (Block)
#     - 0 (Off)
#     - 2 (Audit)
#     
#     Example:
#     xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx            0
#     xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx            1
#     xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx            2
# 
#     Disabled:
#     No ASR rules will be configured.
# 
#     Not configured:
#     Same as Disabled.
# 
#     You can exclude folders or files in the ""Exclude files and paths from Attack Surface Reduction Rules"" GP setting.
