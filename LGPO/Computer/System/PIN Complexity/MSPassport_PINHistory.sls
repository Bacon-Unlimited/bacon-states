#
# This setting specifies the number of past PINs that can be associated to a user account that canâ€™t be reused. This policy enables administrators to enhance security by ensuring that old PINs are not reused continually. PIN history is not preserved through PIN reset.
# 
# The value must be between 0 to 50 PINs. If this policy is set to 0, then storage of previous PINs is not required.
# 
# Default: 0.
