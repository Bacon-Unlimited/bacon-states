#
# This policy setting defines whether a domain controller (DC) should attempt to verify the password provided by a client with the PDC emulator if the DC failed to validate the password.
# 
# Contacting the PDC emulator is useful in case the clientâ€™s password was recently changed and did not propagate to the DC yet. Users may want to disable this feature if the PDC emulator is located over a slow WAN connection.
# 
# If you enable this policy setting, the DCs to which this policy setting applies will attempt to verify a password with the PDC emulator if the DC fails to validate the password.
# 
# If you disable this policy setting, the DCs will not attempt to verify any passwords with the PDC emulator. 
# 
# If you do not configure this policy setting, it is not applied to any DCs.
