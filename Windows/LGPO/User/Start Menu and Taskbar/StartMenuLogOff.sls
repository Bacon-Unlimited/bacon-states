#
# This policy setting allows you to removes the "Log Off <username>" item from the Start menu and prevents users from restoring it.
# 
# If you enable this policy setting, the Log Off <username> item does not appear in the Start menu. This policy setting also removes the Display Logoff item from Start Menu Options. As a result, users cannot restore the Log Off <username> item to the Start Menu.
# 
# If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, users can use the Display Logoff item to add and remove the Log Off item.
# 
# This policy setting affects the Start menu only. It does not affect the Log Off item on the Windows Security dialog box that appears when you press Ctrl+Alt+Del, and it does not prevent users from using other methods to log off.
# 
# Tip: To add or remove the Log Off item on a computer, click Start, click Settings, click Taskbar and Start Menu, click the Start Menu Options tab and, in the Start Menu Settings box, click Display Logoff.
