# windows:SUPPORTED_Windows8
#
# This policy setting specifies whether the BranchCache hash generation service supports version 1 (V1) hashes, version 2 (V2) hashes, or both V1 and V2 hashes. Hashes, also called content information, are created based on the data in shared folders where BranchCache is enabled. 
# 
# If you specify only one version that is supported, content information for that version is the only type that is generated by BranchCache, and it is the only type of content information that can be retrieved by client computers. For example, if you enable support for V1 hashes, BranchCache generates only V1 hashes and client computers can retrieve only V1 hashes.
# 
# Policy configuration
# 
# Select one of the following:
# 
# - Not Configured. With this selection, BranchCache settings are not applied to client computers by this policy setting. In this circumstance, which is the default, both V1 and V2 hash generation and retrieval are supported.
