#
# SUPPORTED WINDOWS OS
# SUPPORTED_IE6SP2
#
# Internet Explorer contains dynamic binary behaviors: components that encapsulate specific functionality for the HTML elements to which they are attached. This policy setting controls whether the Binary Behavior Security Restriction setting  is prevented or allowed.
# 
# This policy setting allows administrators to define applications for which they want this security feature to be prevented or allowed.
# 
# If you enable this policy setting and enter a Value of 1 binary behaviors are prevented. If you enter a Value of 0 binary behaviors are allowed. The Value Name is the name of the executable. If a Value Name is empty or the Value is not 0 or 1, the policy setting is ignored.
# 
# Do not enter the Internet Explorer processes in this list: use the related Internet Explorer Processes policy to enable or disable IE processes. If the All Processes policy setting is enabled, the processes configured in this box take precedence over that setting.
# 
# If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the security feature is allowed.
