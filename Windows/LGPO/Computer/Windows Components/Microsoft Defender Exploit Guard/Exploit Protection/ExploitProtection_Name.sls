# LOCATION: \Computer\Windows Components\Microsoft Defender Exploit Guard\Exploit Protection\ExploitProtection_Name.sls
#
# SUPPORTED WINDOWS OS
# windows:SUPPORTED_Windows_10_0_RS3
#
# Specify a common set of Microsoft Defender Exploit Guard system and application mitigation settings that can be applied to all endpoints that have this GP setting configured.
# 
# There are some prerequisites before you can enable this setting:
# - Manually configure a device's system and application mitigation settings using the Set-ProcessMitigation PowerShell cmdlet, the ConvertTo-ProcessMitigationPolicy PowerShell cmdlet, or directly in Windows Security.
# - Generate an XML file with the settings from the device by running the Get-ProcessMitigation PowerShell cmdlet or using the Export button at the bottom of the Exploit Protection area in Windows Security.
# - Place the generated XML file in a shared or local path. 
# 
# Note: Endpoints that have this GP setting set to Enabled must be able to access the XML file, otherwise the settings will not be applied.
# 
# Enabled
# Specify the location of the XML file in the Options section. You can use a local (or mapped) path, a UNC path, or a URL, such as the following:
# - C:\MitigationSettings\Config.XML
# - \\Server\Share\Config.xml
# - https://localhost:8080/Config.xml
# 
# The settings in the XML file will be applied to the endpoint.
# 
# Disabled
# Common settings will not be applied, and the locally configured settings will be used instead.
# 
# Not configured
# Same as Disabled.
# 
Use a common set of exploit protection settings:
  lgpo.set:
